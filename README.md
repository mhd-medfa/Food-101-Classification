# Food-101-Classification
Our aim is to build and train a decent Food-101 deep
learning classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
with a reasonable set of Augmentations. This project explores
food image classification with convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for better image labeling by dish, which in turn may
improve the recommendation and search flows for a better digital
food user experience overall. Specifically, the goal of the project
is to, given an image of a dish as the input to the model; output
the correct label categorization of the food image
